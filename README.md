# 2D-Animation
Basic 2D Animation using GLUT library on OpenGL

Gives basic idea to implement basic algorithms of Graphics using GLUT library in OpenGL.

The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a library of utilities for OpenGL programs, which primarily perform system-level I/O with the host operating system.

A small project(currently working) integrated using all the basic algorithms.

Open for any suggestions.
